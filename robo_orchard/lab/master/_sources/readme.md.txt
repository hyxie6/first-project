**RoboOrchard** is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to streamline the full lifecycle of robotics research and development, from simulation to real-world application. Within this ecosystem, **RoboOrchardLab** serves as a specialized algorithm repository and experimentation workbench.

It's a flexible, efficient, and extensible platform built to accelerate embodied AI research and development.

Our vision for Lab is to become a central hub for a wide array of algorithms, including not only perception, grasping, and VLAs, but also advanced manipulation and whole-body control in the future.

## Core Features

- Modular Training Framework: Compose and customize your training pipelines like building blocks.
- Efficient Distributed Training: Effortlessly scale to multi-GPU/multi-node setups with Hugging Face Accelerate.
- SOTA Embodied AI Algorithms: Access an expanding suite of state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Initial support focuses on advanced perception, with intelligent grasping policies and end-to-end Vision-Language Action (VLA) models being actively developed and planned for near-future releases. Longer-term, we aim to integrate broader manipulation and whole-body control capabilities.

## Why RoboOrchardLab

1. Unified and Flexible Architecture. Drawing inspiration from leading frameworks like Detectron2 and Diffusers, **RoboOrchardLab** provides a unified yet highly modular framework for training and evaluation. Easily swap or add custom datasets, model components, loss functions, and more to suit your specific research needs.
2. Optimized for Embodied Intelligence. We focus on the unique challenges of embodied AI, integrating our team's latest research in robotic perception, object grasping, and pioneering Vision-Language Action (VLA) capabilities. These plug-and-play modules will help you quickly validate ideas and stay at the forefront of research.
3. Efficient Development & Training Experience. Through deep integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem (e.g., transformers and accelerate), we offer users seamless distributed training capabilities. Combined with clear documentation and rich examples, you can significantly shorten development cycles and iterate on models faster.
4. Integrated into the **RoboOrchard** Ecosystem: As a core part of **RoboOrchard**, Lab seamlessly leverages the ecosystem's strengths. This includes streamlined access to diverse datasets managed within Orchard, standardized interfaces for popular simulation suites, and a cohesive environment that supports the end-to-end research workflow from data generation to algorithm validation.
5. Convenient Benchmarking and SOTA Replication: **RoboOrchardLab** is specifically designed to make benchmarking novel approaches and replicating state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in embodied AI both straightforward and convenient. To achieve this, we are committed to actively implementing and integrating a growing number of SOTA algorithms directly within **RoboOrchardLab**. These algorithms are meticulously documented, structured for easy evaluation against established benchmarks, and serve as reliable baselines. This approach provides you with direct access to proven foundations, significantly simplifying comparative research and accelerating your development cycle.
6. Open Community and Ecosystem. **RoboOrchardLab** is an open-source project, and we warmly welcome developers and researchers from academia and industry to join us. Contribute code, share models, improve documentation, and let's advance embodied intelligence technology together.
