## Why RoboOrchardLab

1. Unified and Flexible Architecture. Drawing inspiration from leading frameworks like Detectron2 and Diffusers, RoboOrchardLab provides a unified yet highly modular framework for training and evaluation. Easily swap or add custom datasets, model components, loss functions, and more to suit your specific research needs.
2. Optimized for Embodied Intelligence. We focus on the unique challenges of embodied AI, integrating our team's latest research in robotic perception, object grasping, and pioneering Vision-Language Action (VLA) capabilities. These plug-and-play modules will help you quickly validate ideas and stay at the forefront of research.
3. Efficient Development & Training Experience. Through deep integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem (e.g., transformers and accelerate), we offer users seamless distributed training capabilities. Combined with clear documentation and rich examples, you can significantly shorten development cycles and iterate on models faster.
4. Open Community and Ecosystem. RoboOrchardLab is an open-source project, and we warmly welcome developers and researchers from academia and industry to join us. Contribute code, share models, improve documentation, and let's advance embodied intelligence technology together.
